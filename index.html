                                        waking up from sleep. Completed my school and college in Mumbai and got placed in a reputed engineering firm in 2013. No looking back since that day. Growing professionally 
                                        admist the challenges that stood on the way, life has beeen rough in its own way. Moved into USA in 2018. Worked as factory floor worker for a while before being rewarded with 
                                        an engineering job on the merits of my previous job experience in the same field. I currently live with my parents and sister. </p>

                                         for sure!) or nature photography. Being responsible to give back for what we get, I believe in charity work to the best of one's ability. </p>
